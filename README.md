# Icelandic movie API
The Icelandic movie API is a free REST service for optaining information about movies showing in Icelandic cinemas. To use this service please fill out the short registration on page [api.kvikmyndir.is](http://api.kvikmyndir.is).

The API is mainly built with data from kvikmyndir.is. Special thanks to them for their contribution. In addition I have added data from bioparadis.is and other services such as OMDB API and The Movie Database API. The data from the API is updated daily.

# Authentication
The API is for non commercial purposes only because of third party data. It uses token based authentication. Before you can access any data from the API you will have to make an authentication POST request. Check out the example on [api.kvikmyndir.is](http://api.kvikmyndir.is).

All API documentation and examples can be found at [api.kvikmyndir.is](http://api.kvikmyndir.is).
